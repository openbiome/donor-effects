# Re-analysis of Jacob et al.

- `patient-data.tsv` has columns:
    - `patient` is a unique identifier
    - `outcome` is (0/1) whether the patient achieved the outcome
    - `pool` is an identifier for each unique combination of donors
    - `donor1` shows (0/1) whether the pool of stool received by that patient included donor 1
